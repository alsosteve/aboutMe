            <p> Hello readers!</p>
            <p> - </p>
            <p> My name is Steve Ngo. I was born and grew up in Orange County, California, where I spent most of my youth and early education. I attended Katella Hogh School where I was pressured to figure out things in my like before it even started. For example, people would ask me questions like: So what are you going to do after High School. Do you have your taxes set up yet? How do you not know how to drive a car yet? What's your favorite color? Side note: It's black BTW. </p>
            <p>-</p>
            <p>Once graduating from High School, I joined the U.S. Army. I joined the army because after graduating and working a cashier job, I realised that school was kind of lame. I was really into photography at the time so I decided to me a military photographer/videographer. I stayed in for 3 years before my auto immune system told me it didn't want to be in the army anymore, long story short, I got medically retired. After leaving the army I found out that they keep all your photos, so legally I had no photographer portfolio. What a bummer... </p>
            <p>-</p>
            <p> I decided to enroll back to school at Fayetteville Technical Community College. I thought why not give it another try. You hve it paid for by the government so if you fail you can always fall back on being a beach bum that plays the banjo on a longboard. I origionally wanted to be a marketing designer but after taking some courses, I found a joy in learning and writing code, also the projected salary didn't hurt. Too bad I figured this out 2 semesters before my graduation... Anyway, I finished with an Associate's Degree in Digital Media, something I can still use in this carrer field. </p>
            <p>-</p>
            <p> Now I am currently seeking a carrer as a web developer and my first bus stop is taking and passing my courses at Code Fellows. </p>
            <p>-</p>
            <p>Wish me luck! </p>
